## 4. Technical Analysis
### 4.1 Remote Code Execution (CWE-89)
The application allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL commands via the `transfer.php` endpoint (`otherNo` parameter). This can be escalated to RCE by writing a PHP web shell to the server using `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`.

### 4.2 Financial Integrity Failures (CWE-190 & CWE-362)
* **Integer Overflow:** The transfer logic fails to validate negative inputs, allowing users to "transfer" negative amounts (effectively stealing funds).
* **Race Condition:** The transaction processing logic lacks atomic locks (e.g., `FOR UPDATE`), allowing parallel requests to spend the same balance multiple times.

### 4.3 Access Control Failures (CWE-639 & CWE-79)
Administrative dashboards (`mindex.php`) are accessible to unprivileged users via IDOR, and audit logs are vulnerable to Stored XSS (`feedback.php`), allowing attackers to hijack administrator sessions.

## 5. Remediation Recommendations
This software is fundamentally insecure and should **not** be used in any production environment. For educational remediation:
1.  **Use Transactions:** Wrap all balance updates in `START TRANSACTION` ... `COMMIT` blocks.
2.  **Input Validation:** Reject all negative numbers at the API level.
3.  **Prepared Statements:** Rewrite all queries using `mysqli_prepare()`.
